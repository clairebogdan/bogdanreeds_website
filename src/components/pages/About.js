        <h1>About Bogdan Reeds</h1>
        <p>Bogdan Reeds was established in 2017 under its original name, Oboe Reeds 
            by Claire Bogdan. In June 2019, the name was changed to Bogdan Reeds. Bogdan Reeds 
            is owned and operated by Claire Bogdan. Claire Bogdan is a full-time software engineer 
            in Columbus, Ohio, but is also a professionally trained oboist and former middle school 
            band director. 

            Claire learned how to make reeds when she was 12 years old. Over several years, she 
            perfected her craft of making reeds. Claire studied with oboe Rebecca Nagel at the 
            Univeristy of South Carolina, where she obtained her Bachelor of Music Education degree 
            and her Perforamnce Certificate in Oboe. While at UofSC, Claire was the principal oboist of the Wind Ensemble. Claire also performed 
            with the UofSC Symphony Orchestra and various chamber ensembles.

            In 2016, Claire began selling reeds to her friends that needed oboe reeds for their 
            college classes. In 2017, under the original name Oboe Reeds by Claire Bogdan, Claire 
            expanded her customer network by selling reeds to local middle and high schools. Word 
            started to spread, and people outside of her network started contacting her for reeds. 

            While Claire was a middle school band director from 2017-2019, she continued to make and sell 
            her reeds in her spare time. However, in June 2019, Claire left teaching to 
            pursue a degree in Computer Science. During this time, Claire worked as a freelance oboist -- 
            she taught 12 private students, performed with the Charleston Wind Symphony, and changed the name 
            of her reed business to Bogdan Reeds. Bogdan Reeds started to have even more reach, selling to 
            oboists all over the country! 

            As of October 2020, Claire is a full-time software engineer in Columbus, Ohio. Just as she did when 
            she was a teacher, she continues to make and sell her reeds in her spare time. While she cannot 
            make reeds in as large quantities as she used to when she was freelancing, Claire really enjoys 
            the art of making reeds!
